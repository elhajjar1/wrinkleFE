The fastest way to use WrinkleFE is the hosted Streamlit app — no install required:

### [Launch the WrinkleFE Streamlit app](https://wrinklefe.streamlit.app/)

Pick a material, set the wrinkle amplitude / wavelength / morphology, and the
app returns the analytical knockdown, plots, and (optionally) a full FE solve.
Public link, no account needed.

## Features

- **Compression model:** CLT-weighted Budiansky-Fleck kink-band with layup-dependent confinement
- **Tension model:** Three-mechanism (fiber cos^2 theta, Hashin matrix, curved-beam sigma_33 delamination) with thick-ply in-situ correction
- **3D finite element:** Structured hexahedral mesh with LaRC04/05 failure criteria
- **Five morphologies:** Stack, convex, concave, uniform, graded (with configurable decay floor)
- **Graded averaging:** Through-thickness ply-averaged knockdown for graded wrinkles
- **Movable wrinkle position:** Configurable through-thickness placement (`wrinkle_z_position`, 0.5 = mid-plane)
- **Resin-pocket material zone:** Graded neat-epoxy lens at the wrinkle crest (modulus + fibre-angle blend, counted once) via `wrinklefe.core.resin_pocket`
- **Progressive-damage FE:** Load-stepping `ProgressiveDamageSolver` to ultimate load with optional crack-band (Bažant–Oh) regularization — the first FE route to a UD compression knockdown
- **Penetration gate (θ, D/T, z):** Closed-form two-parameter UD predictor `KD = 1 − (1 − KD_angle(θ))·S(D/T)·P(z)` with calibrated presets; zero FE cost (`wrinklefe.core.penetration_gate`)
- **Linear buckling:** Geometric-stiffness eigenvalue solve (`LinearBucklingSolver`) with a microbuckling knockdown — verified structural-buckling infrastructure, but a homogenised-continuum eigenvalue does not capture the *fibre-scale* wrinkle knockdown (it gets the sign wrong: the bifurcation load *rises* with the wrinkle), so it is **not** the production UD predictor (the penetration gate is); see the [modelling findings](docs/wrinkle_modeling_findings.md)
- **11 built-in laminate materials** (AS4/3501-6, IM7/8552, T300/914, T700/2510, AC318/S6C10 S-glass/epoxy, T800S/M21, IM10/8552, IM6G/3501-6 carbon/epoxy — the Hsiao & Daniel 1996 wavy-UD study, S-2 glass/epoxy, Kevlar-49/epoxy, plus `AC318_S6C10_vacbag` — the Li 2025 vacuum-bag realization, measured Xc=335.5 MPa, E1=50.8 GPa) plus an isotropic neat-epoxy card (`EPOXY_S6C10`) for the resin-pocket zone
- **Comprehensive test suite** covering all modules (run `pytest` to see the current count)

## Quick Start

### Streamlit web app

The fastest path is the hosted Streamlit instance — no install, no Python
required: **<https://wrinklefe.streamlit.app/>**. Pick a material from the
sidebar (or **Custom…** to enter your own elastic constants and strength
allowables), enter a layup in contracted notation (e.g. `[0/45/-45/90]_3s`),
set the wrinkle geometry, and click **Run analysis**. The app ships with
per-morphology schematic cartoons, a live wrinkle preview, and the same
analytical + FE pipeline as the Python API. See
[`DEPLOYMENT_STREAMLIT.md`](docs/internal/DEPLOYMENT_STREAMLIT.md) for the full feature
tour and instructions for self-hosting.

To run the app locally:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
streamlit run app.py
```

### Python API

```python
from wrinklefe.analysis import AnalysisConfig, WrinkleAnalysis

config = AnalysisConfig(
    amplitude=0.366, wavelength=16.0, width=12.0,
    morphology="stack", loading="compression",
)
result = WrinkleAnalysis(config).run()
print(result.summary())
```

Runnable scripts for the common workflows — parametric sweeps,
morphology comparison, CZM delamination, export round-trips, custom
materials — live in [`examples/`](examples/); each states its expected
runtime and output, and CI executes them all so they stay current.
The full API reference and user guide are built from [`docs/`](docs/)
with Sphinx (`pip install -e ".[docs]" && sphinx-build -W docs
docs/_build`) and published at
<https://wrinklefe.readthedocs.io>.

`amplitude` (`A`) is the **half-amplitude** [mm]: the peak displacement
of the wrinkled mid-surface from the flat (unwrinkled) reference plane,
so `z(x) = A·cos(2πx/λ)` (modulated by the envelope) and the
peak-to-trough height is `2A`. For a measured wrinkle (e.g. from a
cross-section micrograph or CT slice), `A = (z_max − z_min) / 2`. The
peak fibre misalignment angle scales as `θ_max ≈ arctan(2πA/λ)`, which
drives the Budiansky-Fleck compressive knockdown.

### Wrinkle geometry parameters

All wrinkle length parameters use a single, consistent unit:
**millimetres (mm)** — the same unit as `ply_thickness` and
`domain_length` (the default `amplitude=0.366` mm is exactly two ply
thicknesses of 0.183 mm). Lengths are **not** normalized by thickness.
The longitudinal coordinate `x` runs along the laminate in the fibre
direction; out-of-plane displacement `z(x)` is measured from the flat
(undeformed) mid-surface. Angles are in **radians**.

This table is the canonical reference for every wrinkle-geometry
parameter exposed by `AnalysisConfig`, the CLI, and the Streamlit UI.
The `AnalysisConfig` docstrings, CLI `--help`, and Streamlit `help=`
tooltips all mirror these definitions; the
`tests/test_param_docs_match.py` regression test pins the defaults so
the docs and the dataclass cannot drift.

| Parameter | Units | Default | Definition | Constraint |
|-----------|-------|---------|------------|------------|
| `amplitude` (A) | mm | `0.366` | Half-amplitude: peak displacement of the wrinkled mid-surface from the flat reference, with `z(x) = A·cos(2π(x − x₀)/λ)` (modulated by the envelope) and peak-to-trough height `2A`. For a measured wrinkle, `A = (z_max − z_min)/2`. | ≥ 0 (`0` = flat / no wrinkle) |
| `wavelength` (λ) | mm | `16.0` | Spatial period of the `cos(2π(x − x₀)/λ)` carrier along the longitudinal x-direction (crest-to-crest distance). Wavenumber `k = 2π/λ`. | > 0 |
| `width` (w) | mm | `12.0` | Longitudinal envelope decay length about the centre `x₀`. Exact meaning is profile-dependent: Gaussian 1/e length scale in `exp(−(x−x₀)²/w²)`, tapered flat-top extent (`\|x−x₀\| < w/2`), or triangular half-base (`\|x−x₀\| < w`). Also used as the transverse (y-direction) extent of the wrinkle in 3-D dual-wrinkle / graded mesh deformation. | > 0 |
| `phase` (φ) | rad | `None` | Explicit dual-wrinkle phase offset between the two wrinkle centrelines. `None` derives φ from `morphology` via `MORPHOLOGY_PHASES` (stack φ=0, convex φ=+π/2, concave φ=−π/2). A float overrides the named-morphology phase so arbitrary offsets can be swept (e.g. `0` to `π`). Ignored for single-wrinkle morphologies (`uniform`, `graded`). | finite when set |
| `decay_floor` | dimensionless | `0.0` | Graded morphology only: minimum fraction of the wrinkle amplitude retained at the laminate outer surfaces. `0.0` = full decay to zero amplitude at the surfaces (pure graded); `1.0` = no decay (equivalent to `uniform`). | in `[0, 1]` |
| `amplitude_profile` | name | `"constant"` | Spatially varying in-plane modulation of the wrinkle amplitude `A`, applied on top of the wrinkle's own longitudinal envelope. `"constant"` (default) preserves the legacy uniform `A`; `"gaussian"` multiplies `A` by `exp(−(s/d)²)`; `"linear"` multiplies `A` by `max(0, 1 − \|s\|/d)` (clipped). `s` is the coordinate from the wrinkle centre along `amplitude_profile_axis` and `d` is `amplitude_profile_decay_length`. | one of `constant`, `gaussian`, `linear` |
| `amplitude_profile_decay_length` | mm | `None` | Decay length `d` (mm) for the Gaussian sigma or linear-decay extent. `None` falls back to the wrinkle profile's own `width`. Ignored when `amplitude_profile == "constant"`. | finite and > 0 when set |
| `amplitude_profile_axis` | axis | `"x"` | In-plane axis along which the amplitude modulation runs. Pick `"y"` for an independent transverse tapering of `A` that does not stack with the existing longitudinal envelope on `x`. | one of `x`, `y` |

Peak fibre misalignment: `θ_max ≈ arctan(2πA/λ)` (exact for a pure
cosine; dimensionless because A and λ share the mm length unit). See the
`WrinkleProfile` class docstring in `src/wrinklefe/core/wrinkle.py` for
the full per-profile geometric definitions.

### Tension analysis

```python
config = AnalysisConfig(
    amplitude=0.366, wavelength=16.0, width=12.0,
    morphology="stack", loading="tension",
    angles=[0, 45, 90, -45, 0, 45, -45, 0, 0, -45, 45, 0, -45, 90, 45, 0],
    ply_thickness=0.152,
)
result = WrinkleAnalysis(config).run()
print(result.summary())
```

### Graded morphology (embedded wrinkle)

```python
config = AnalysisConfig(
    amplitude=0.5, wavelength=15.0, width=11.0,
    morphology="graded", decay_floor=0.0,
    loading="compression",
)
result = WrinkleAnalysis(config).run()
print(result.analytical_knockdown)
```

### Resin pocket + progressive-damage FE (UD compression)

For a unidirectional wrinkle, tag the soft neat-epoxy lens at the crest
and load-step to ultimate with the progressive-damage solver:

```python
from wrinklefe.analysis import AnalysisConfig, WrinkleAnalysis
from wrinklefe.core.material import MaterialLibrary

lib = MaterialLibrary()
config = AnalysisConfig(
    amplitude=0.366, wavelength=16.0, width=12.0,
    morphology="graded", loading="compression",
    material=lib.get("AC318_S6C10"),
    enable_resin_pocket=True,                       # graded epoxy lens at the crest
    resin_pocket_material=lib.get("EPOXY_S6C10"),   # default if left None
    enable_progressive_damage=True,                 # load-step to ultimate
    progressive_n_increments=15,
)
result = WrinkleAnalysis(config).run()
print(result.progressive_knockdown, result.progressive_strength_MPa)
```

### Penetration gate (θ, D/T, z) — UD, zero FE cost

The closed-form two-parameter gate predicts a UD knockdown directly from
geometry. Call it on its own with a calibrated preset:

```python
from wrinklefe.core.penetration_gate import penetration_gate_kd, GATE_LI2024_MOULDED

kd = penetration_gate_kd(theta_deg=8.0, dt=0.10, params=GATE_LI2024_MOULDED)
print(kd)
```

Or drive it through `AnalysisConfig.penetration_gate` so
`analytical_knockdown` (and `analytical_strength_MPa`) come from the gate
instead of Budiansky–Fleck (use `GATE_LI2025_VACBAG` with
`AC318_S6C10_vacbag` for the vacuum-bag realization):

```python
from wrinklefe.analysis import AnalysisConfig, WrinkleAnalysis
from wrinklefe.core.material import MaterialLibrary
from wrinklefe.core.penetration_gate import GATE_LI2024_MOULDED

lib = MaterialLibrary()
config = AnalysisConfig(
    amplitude=0.366, wavelength=16.0, width=12.0,
    morphology="uniform", loading="compression",
    material=lib.get("AC318_S6C10"),
    penetration_gate=GATE_LI2024_MOULDED,
)
result = WrinkleAnalysis(config).run(analytical_only=True)
print(result.analytical_knockdown)
```

When `penetration_gate` is left unset (the default `None`), the
analytical knockdown is unchanged.

### Batch parametric sweeps

For exploring how the knockdown varies across a parameter range, use
`WrinkleAnalysis.parametric_sweep` to sweep a single
`AnalysisConfig` field (any numeric field — `amplitude`, `wavelength`,
`width`, `phase`, `applied_strain`, ...):

```python
from wrinklefe.analysis import AnalysisConfig, WrinkleAnalysis

base = AnalysisConfig(
    amplitude=0.366, wavelength=16.0, width=12.0,
    morphology="stack", loading="compression",
)
results = WrinkleAnalysis.parametric_sweep(
    base, parameter="amplitude", values=[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4],
    analytical_only=True,
)
for r in results:
    print(f"A={r.config.amplitude:.3f}  KD={r.analytical_knockdown:.4f}")
```

For multi-parameter cross-product sweeps with JSON output and plots,
use `wrinklefe.sweep.run_sweep`:

```python
import numpy as np
from wrinklefe.sweep import run_sweep, save_sweep_results, plot_sweep_results

sweep = run_sweep({
    "amplitude":  np.linspace(0.183, 0.549, 3),
    "wavelength": np.linspace(8.0, 24.0, 3),
})
save_sweep_results(sweep, "./sweep_output/")
plot_sweep_results(sweep, "./sweep_output/")
```

### Command line

```bash
wrinklefe --help

# Single-parameter sweep (analytical-only is the default, fast)
wrinklefe sweep --parameter amplitude --min 0.1 --max 0.5 --steps 5
```

### Exporting results to CSV / JSON

Numeric outputs (load factor, per-ply failure index, knockdown factors,
stress-field summary) can be written to a schema-versioned JSON or a
Pandas-friendly per-ply CSV for downstream comparison and plotting in
Excel, Pandas, or shared Jupyter notebooks:

```python
from wrinklefe.analysis import AnalysisConfig, WrinkleAnalysis
from wrinklefe.io.results import export_results_csv, export_results_json

result = WrinkleAnalysis(AnalysisConfig()).run()

export_results_json(result, "results.json")  # schema-versioned JSON
export_results_csv(result, "per_ply.csv")    # per-ply tabular CSV
```

The JSON output is deterministic (`sort_keys=True`), pins a top-level
`schema_version` field, and reduces large numpy arrays (e.g.
per-Gauss-point stress fields) to summary statistics so the file stays
compact. The CSV is one row per ply with columns `ply_index,
angle_deg, max_FI, min_RF, critical_mode, critical_criterion`, suitable
for `pandas.read_csv` or `csv.DictReader`.

Every JSON export carries a `provenance` block recording the installed
WrinkleFE version (never a hardcoded literal), the Python/numpy/scipy
versions, the platform, a UTC timestamp, and a solver snapshot — so a
result file can be audited and reproduced against the validation
ledger. The NCR validation summary (`build_analysis_summary`) embeds
the same block, and the top-level `wrinklefe_version` field reflects
the real installed version.

The Streamlit web app exposes the same exports as **Download results as
JSON** and **Download per-ply results as CSV** buttons on the Export
tab.

## Validation

### What the in-repo tests check

The integration tests under `tests/test_integration/` exercise the full
`WrinkleAnalysis` pipeline and assert physical-sanity properties of the
analytical knockdown rather than reproducing absolute experimental
strengths:

- `test_elhajjar_validation.py` (10 tests): zero-amplitude returns
  knockdown ≈ 1, knockdown decreases monotonically with amplitude,
  morphology ordering convex > stack > concave in compression, knockdown
  stays in `(0, 1]`, and strength equals `Xc * knockdown`.
- `test_tension_validation.py` (13 tests): tension pipeline completes,
  uses `Xt` (not `Xc`), three-mechanism (`kd_fiber`, `kd_matrix`,
  `kd_oop`) decomposition is populated with the controlling mode, and
  tension knockdown is no more severe than compression for the same
  defect.

These act as regression guards on the analytical model. They are not a
quantitative validation against experimental data: this repository does
not currently ship the Elhajjar (2025), Mukhopadhyay (2015), or Li et
al. (2026) experimental data points, nor a script that regenerates
case-by-case error statistics. (Tracking issue: #22.)

### Quantitative validation against experiment

Comparison of the analytical predictions against published experimental
data is documented in the accompanying paper:

- Elhajjar, R. (2025). *Fat-tailed failure strength distributions and
  manufacturing defects in advanced composites.* Scientific Reports,
  15:25977. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-06693-4

Additional datasets referenced by the model calibration (Mukhopadhyay
et al., 2015; Li et al., 2026) are cited in [References](#references)
below. Reproducing case-level pass/fail tables from this repository
alone is not currently possible — the raw data and regeneration script
are not included.

For a consolidated predicted-vs-experimental view, the script
[`validation/plot_all_validation.py`](validation/plot_all_validation.py)
regenerates `validation/fig_all_validation_parity.png`: a single parity
plot of every single-wrinkle case (Datasets A–F) inside a ±20% band,
with each dataset predicted by the model that physically applies to it
(Budiansky–Fleck / three-mechanism for the multidirectional cases A–D,
the penetration gate for the UD cases E/F).

### Stiffness (modulus) knockdown

Besides strength, WrinkleFE reports a **stiffness** knockdown of the axial
Young's modulus two ways: the FE `modulus_retention` (wrinkled vs pristine
from the linear static solve, any layup) and — for unidirectional layups —
a closed-form `analytical_modulus_knockdown` (a CLT series-average of the
off-axis lamina modulus over the wrinkle profile, no FE solve). The script
[`validation/validate_modulus.py`](validation/validate_modulus.py) scores
both against the UD datasets that report a *measured modulus* — **F**
(Li 2025, S-glass), **G** (Hsiao & Daniel 1996, carbon — the
`IM6G_3501_6` card), and the indicative **E** (Li 2024). The analytical estimate lands at
3.9 % MAE (F) / 1.2 % (G) and the FE at 6.9 % (F) / 5.1 % (G). The data
and both models agree that stiffness is far more wrinkle-tolerant than
strength: the modulus knockdown stays ≈0.81–0.98 for the S-glass cases
and only reaches ≈0.52–0.57 for a carbon uniform wrinkle at θ = 15°. The
script
[`validation/plot_modulus_validation.py`](validation/plot_modulus_validation.py)
renders the comparison as `validation/fig_modulus_validation.png` —
knockdown-vs-angle and a predicted-vs-experimental parity plot across all
three datasets.

## Supported morphologies

WrinkleFE ships five wrinkle morphologies (defined in
`src/wrinklefe/core/morphology.py`). They differ along *two* independent
axes: **how many wrinkles** are placed in the laminate and **how the
amplitude varies through the thickness**. The first three names below
are *dual-wrinkle* modes distinguished by the phase offset φ between
two adjacent wrinkle centrelines (the through-thickness amplitude
follows a linear taper from the wrinkle interface plies down to zero
at the laminate outer surfaces). The last two are *single-wrinkle*
modes that swap that taper for a different through-thickness profile.

| Morphology   | # wrinkles | Phase φ | Through-thickness amplitude            | M_f (compression) | When to use                                                                                                                                          |
|--------------|------------|---------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `stack`      | 2          | 0       | Linear decay, 1 at interface → 0 at surfaces | 1.0 (baseline)    | Two aligned wrinkles, peaks-over-peaks. The dual-wrinkle reference case used to scale `convex` / `concave`.                                          |
| `convex`     | 2          | +π/2    | Linear decay, 1 at interface → 0 at surfaces | < 1               | Two phase-shifted wrinkles whose interface bulges outward. *Least* damaging dual-wrinkle case in compression.                                       |
| `concave`    | 2          | −π/2    | Linear decay, 1 at interface → 0 at surfaces | > 1               | Two phase-shifted wrinkles whose interface pinches inward. *Most* damaging dual-wrinkle case in compression — design-driving.                       |
| `uniform`    | 1          | n/a     | Full amplitude on **every** ply (no decay)   | 1.0 (no pairing)  | A single through-thickness-wide wrinkle — every ply wavy with the same A. Conservative bound and sanity-check baseline.                              |
| `graded`     | 1          | n/a     | Linear decay from mid-ply to surfaces, with floor `decay_floor` ∈ [0, 1] | 1.0 (no pairing) | An embedded wrinkle that fades toward the surface plies. `decay_floor=0` is pure graded; `decay_floor=1` collapses to `uniform`.                    |

### `stack` vs `uniform` — what's the difference?

These two get conflated because both have `M_f = 1.0`, but they model
very different defects:

- **`stack`** places **two** wrinkles at adjacent interfaces with
  φ = 0 (aligned crests). Through the thickness the wrinkle decays
  linearly from the interface plies to zero at the outer surfaces —
  surface plies are flat.
- **`uniform`** places a **single** wrinkle and disables the
  through-thickness decay — every ply, including the outer surfaces,
  is displaced by the full profile.

For the same `amplitude` / `wavelength`, `apply_to_nodes` therefore
produces *different* deformed meshes: `stack` has a wrinkle
concentrated near the interface plies (and flat top/bottom plies),
while `uniform` has a wrinkle of the same amplitude at every single
ply. The `M_f = 1.0` coincidence is purely the analytical knockdown
parameter — the FE geometry, the per-ply fibre-angle field, and the
predicted ply-by-ply failure are not the same.

## Supported failure criteria

The criteria below live in `src/wrinklefe/failure/` and can be selected
through `FailureEvaluator` or used independently:

- **LaRC04/05** (`larc05.py`) — Pinho/Camanho 3-D criterion with
  fibre-kinking under compression, in-situ matrix strengths, and a
  fracture-plane search. Default for the FE solve.
- **Tsai-Wu** (`tsai_wu.py`) — 3-D tensor-polynomial criterion with a
  configurable interaction coefficient.
- **Tsai-Hill** (`tsai_hill.py`) — 3-D extension of the classical
  quadratic Tsai-Hill index.
- **Hashin** (`hashin.py`) — 3-D Hashin criterion with separate
  fibre-tension/-compression and matrix-tension/-compression modes.
- **Puck** (`puck.py`) — action-plane (Mode A/B/C) inter-fibre-failure
  criterion with simplified fibre failure.
- **Maximum Stress** (`max_stress.py`) and **Maximum Strain**
  (`max_strain.py`) — non-interactive checks against the principal
  material-frame allowables.
- **Budiansky-Fleck kink-band** (`kinkband.py`) — analytical compression
  knockdown with an optional interlaminar damage coupling
  (`InterlaminarDamage`); this is the model exposed in the
  `analytical_knockdown` field of `AnalysisResults`.
- **Progressive damage** (`progressive.py`) — `PlyDiscount` and
  `ContinuumDamage` post-failure stiffness reduction models that wrap
  any of the criteria above.

## How It Works

The full mechanism-by-mechanism derivation lives on the
[Theory: physics & mechanics](https://wrinklefe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/theory.html)
page (`docs/theory.md`). The essentials:

### Wrinkle kinematics

A wrinkle is reduced to its peak fibre-misalignment angle

```
theta_max = arctan(2*pi*A / lambda)
```

(half-amplitude `A`, wavelength `λ`) and — for unidirectional laminates —
its through-thickness penetration `D/T = A/T` (`T` = laminate thickness).
`theta_eff = M_f * theta_max` folds in the morphology factor `M_f`
(`stack` = 1, `convex` < 1, `concave` > 1).

### Compression — CLT-weighted Budiansky–Fleck kink-band

```
KD_lam      = f_0 * KD_BF + (1 - f_0)
KD_BF       = 1 / (1 + r + c_AF * r^2),   r = theta_eff / gamma_Y_eff
gamma_Y_eff = max(0.032 + 0.050 * f_confined
                        - 0.010 * max(n_block_max - 1, 0),  0.016)
```

`f_0` is the axial-stiffness fraction carried by the 0° plies (the plies
that kink); the `(1 - f_0)` term is the off-axis plies riding through at
full strength. The matrix shear-yield strain `gamma_Y_eff` **rises** with
the confinement `f_confined` (off-axis neighbours bracing the 0° plies
against kink-band rotation) and **falls** with the longest run of
consecutive 0° plies `n_block_max` (blocked 0° plies kink more easily),
floored at half the UD value. So a dispersed `[0/45/90/-45]s` resists
wrinkle knockdown far better than a blocked `[0_4/90_4]s`. The optional
Argon–Fleck quadratic term `c_AF` (`kink_band_quadratic_coeff`) defaults
to `0` — the pure linear Budiansky–Fleck floor.

### Tension — three-mechanism minimum, CLT-weighted

```
KD_lam = f_0 * min(cos^2(theta), KD_matrix, KD_oop) + (1 - f_0)
```

The 0° ply knockdown is the *most severe* of three competing mechanisms:
fibre load-rotation (`cos^2(theta)`), in-situ matrix cracking (a
Hashin/LaRC `σ22`–`τ12` interaction with a thick-ply in-situ strength
correction, `KD_matrix`), and a curved-beam out-of-plane delamination
check (`KD_oop`: the wrinkle curvature drives an interlaminar `σ33` at the
crest and `τ13` at the flanks). A Benzeggagh–Kenane mixed-mode
delamination-*onset* knockdown is reported alongside, and the tension
knockdown is floored by the compression value for the same defect
("tension is never worse than compression").

### Graded morphology

For the `graded` morphology the knockdown is averaged over the wrinkle
profile in both the longitudinal (`x`) and through-thickness (`z`)
directions. The **compression** path weights each ply by a Gaussian
through-thickness envelope centred at `wrinkle_z_position` (decay scale
`max(λ/2, A)`); the **tension** path uses an analogous linear taper. In
both, `decay_floor` sets the surface-ply amplitude: `0` is a fully
embedded wrinkle that fades to flat at the surfaces, `1` collapses to
`uniform`.
